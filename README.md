# CMME to MEI XSL Style Sheet
This repository contains an [XSL style sheet](https://github.com/larrybe/uol_cmme_mei_xsl/blob/main/cmme_to_mei.xsl) that transforms a [CMME](https://cmme.org/) file to [MEI](https://music-encoding.org/).

This XSL stylesheet is used in the web based [CMME to MEI file converter](https://larrybe.github.io/cmme_mei/) but it can also be used with other XSLT processors.
